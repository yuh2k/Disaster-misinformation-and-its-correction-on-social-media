## Introduction to the research



> "Hurricane Sandy will always be remembered for its devastating affects through several states across the northeastern United States. "

Sandy was formed 500 kilometers southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, on October 22, 2012, at 12:00 am UTC. It grew in size and re-intensified as it moved northeast along the US coast, reaching maximum wind speeds of 85 knots at 12:00 am UTC on October 29, roughly 350 kilometers southeast of Atlantic City. Sandy deteriorated to a post-tropical storm the next day and made landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey, at 23:30 UTC on October 29. The wind reached 70 knots at landfall, while the storm surge peaked up to 3.85 meters along with the New Jersey and New York coasts. The storm surge caused the majority of the damage to homes, with up to 650,000 homes damaged. In some areas, power outages persisted for weeks, affecting almost 8.5 million people.

The flooding rumor about the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which claimed that the trading floor was inundated with more than 3 feet of water, is spread widely on Twitter. The rumor made its way to CNN, where meteorologist Chad Myers announced that the NYSE was under 3 feet of water, citing the National Weather Service as a source.

## Visualizations for information dissemination networks

### Gephi Visualizations 

Connections among social media users can be reflected with multiple relations. One of the most straightforward indicators is follower-followee relationships. However, users often are following hundreds of thousands of users, whose tweeting frequencies vary significantly. Retweeting or mentioning activities requires more active actions of users, and therefore is considered a better connection between users. Since retweets include the original author’s username, annotated by “@”, in this study we consider retweeting as a sub-group of mentioning.

So based on the retweeting and "@" records, we build up information dissemination relationships in Twitter. Thus, we could build dissemination networks based on these relationships and visualize them.
